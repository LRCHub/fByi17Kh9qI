It was July hot 'cross Georgia
On my way to Myrtle Beach
I just got my diploma
So I set out in search of me

The honeymoon was over
And Alabama was far away
From being little more
Than just a southern state

I got a gig down at the Bowery
I played for tips and watered drinks
Just a novice in a business
That's seldom what it seems

And where are you goin' Tar Top
Where's J. C. And The Chosen Few
I saw the Flash without T. Gentry
And B. V. left for Malibu

I was July hot and thirty
Some years down the line
When the Boys touched the nation
Unaware at the time

I got to go to Texas
Tennessee and New York, too
A farm boy who is thankful
To be standin' in his shoes

But in the Bowery hangs the memories
Of dreams that still come true
Every time I see the spotlights
I'm one of the chosen few

And where are you going Tar Top
Where's J. C. and the Chosen Few
There's no Flash without T. Gentry
And B. V. where are you?

Where are you goin' Tar Top?
Which direction will you take?
What's this contrabanded clamor
About the music that you make?

And where are you goin' Tar Top
Is it country enough
Is it contemporary glamour
No it's us, just us

One more time for Knoxville, Tennessee
