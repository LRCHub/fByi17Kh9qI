Was in the spring, one summer day
My sweetheart left me, Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
Lord I'm sittin on top of the world

She called me up, from down in El Paso
She said come back daddy, oh I need you so
But now she's gone but I don't worry
Lord I'm sittin on top of the world

If you don't like my peaches don't you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be
But now she's gone but I don't worry
Lord I'm sittin on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
My sweetheart left me, Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
Lord I'm sittin on top of the world
