Chromed out custom 355 been straight rollin' since 1969.

I don't take it out girl, just anytime
But I'mma drop the top
I wanna take you for a ride in this chevy Camaro that I got from my daddy
I'mma pick you up in about 20

If you ain't ready to go, get ready to go

With that sun drop drippin' on the black top sippin' on sweet tea free
As we'll ever be go on let your hair go, you're puttin' on a shotgun show that tie dyed sky your lips,
Your eyes got my heart runnin' like it's under the hood
And my head's spinnin' whenever you're in it this drop top with the top dropped never looked so good (so good)

You're like cali meets Georgia,
Flops on your feet,
Camouflage hat flipped back,
Aviator dream,
Tight white tank top red bikini underneath,
Little wink from the passenger seat

Girl you know what you're doing lookin' like a star in a movie with them jeans tighter than a koozie and I'm ready to go (I'm ready to go)

With that sun drop drippin' on the black top sippin' on sweet tea free as we'll ever be go on let your hair go, you're puttin' on a shotgun show that tie dyed sky your lips, your eyes got my heart runnin' like it's under the hood and my head's spinnin' whenever you're in it this drop top with the top dropped never looked so good (so good)

You know you wanna sing every little thing that's coming from the radio like whoah (like whoah) whoah

With that sun drop drippin' on the black top sippin' on sweet tea free as we'll ever be go on let your hair go, you're puttin' on a shotgun show that tie dyed sky your lips, your eyes got my heart runnin' like it's under the hood and my head's spinnin' whenever you're in it this drop top with the top dropped never looked so good (so good x3)
